# Feature description

**Scenario:** invoice calculator.
A store carries a variety of different products. The sales tax for these products is different by product category.
For example cigarettes and alcohol might have a higher tax rate than medicine.

**Goals:** Given a list of products the shopping cart needs to calculate:
* the total price before tax
* the total after tax and the total amount of taxes (split by category).

**Example input:**
```
product id   quantity
---------------------
apple               5
orange              4
milk                2
red wine            3
stamps              4
```

**Desired output:**
```
product id   quantity   price (each)  price (total)   tax rate  tax amount
